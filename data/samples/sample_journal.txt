I've been feeling completely drained for the past few weeks. No matter how much I sleep, I wake up exhausted. My motivation at work has dropped significantly — tasks that used to excite me now feel like an unbearable chore. I've started withdrawing from colleagues and skipping team lunches. Even on weekends I can't seem to recharge. I'm worried this might be more than just regular tiredness.
